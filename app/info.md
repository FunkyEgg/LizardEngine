# App info

The app is going to a visual editor for the engine.

What it will serve as is a easier way to use the [engine](../engine/mod.js)

It will also use [tauri](https://tauri.studio/) as a way to get it on desktop

I belive that work will not start on this for a while as i dont currently see a need for it
